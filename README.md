google-homepage is my first try on replicating the google-homepage
I've learned the following:
Questions: what are the "data-ogsr" tags, how does the "aria" tag work
CSS created. started on top of the site.
i didnt just made the structure and tried to recreate the visuals. i nearly coppied the structur of google which is way more intricate.
im thinkin to start over.
